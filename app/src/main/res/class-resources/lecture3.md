## Buttons

- Java listeners are looking at a specific view or location and are listening for some events
- We assign some listener to some view. Whenever something changes, the listener knows. 
- We use different listeners for different android classes, like buttons. There are different events that can happen in each view. For buttons the even that can happen is onClick(). The way that we can know someone clicks on the button is by assigning one listener (setOnClickListener()). We can set a listener by implementing the anonymous class. 
- There are similar functions for different views. For check boxes we have setOnCheckListener. Text fields have listeners too.
